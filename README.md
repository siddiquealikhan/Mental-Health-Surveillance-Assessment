## Overview

**Facial-Emotion-Recognition** is a comprehensive developer toolkit designed to enable **real-time facial emotion detection** using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It offers an end-to-end pipeline—from dataset labeling and model training to live inference—making it ideal for building interactive emotion-aware applications.

### Why Facial-Emotion-Recognition?

-  **Neural Network Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for classifying 7 facial emotions from grayscale images.  
-  **Real-Time Detection**: Live webcam analysis powered by OpenCV.  
-  **Full Pipeline**: End-to-end support for data collection, labeling, training, and deployment.  
-  **Web Interface**: React-based frontend for interactive visualization.  
-  **Flexible & Extensible**: Modular architecture for easy customization.
